This Notebook is the result of my Ecole Polytechnique's INF581 - Advanced Machine Learning and Autonomous Agents course. Goal was to train an autonomous agent to play Blackjack - and maybe to have a positive outcome in average.

You will find the implementation of :
* naïve algorithms
* Q-Learning
* Neural Network
* Deep Q-Learning

in the eponym folders.
The details of all of work is in the .pdf file.

I realized this project with Jean-Peïc Chou and Nicolas Gys.
